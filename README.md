As a developer I was tasked with creating a password generator, that provided a secure random password. The requirements of the password included: character length ranging from 8-128, minimum 1 uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character. 
In order to complete this I implemented HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My main tasked was to refactor the provided JavaScript in order to properly execute the password generator.
